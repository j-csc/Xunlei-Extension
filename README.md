# Xunlei Safari App Extension
This is a safari download extension that I created during my working days in XunLei Thunder Inc. 

It sniffers out all the downloadable links inside a standard webpage (not including paid or custom video services: Youtube, Youku etc.)
and creates a downloadable thunder:// link for it.

Best used when paired with the Mac Thunder application.
